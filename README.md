# L_Compiler2
======
At the request of the compilation technology course, 
the basic implementation of the compiler for the simplified language of Pascal, the L language,
was completed. Includes lexer, parser, semantic analysis and object code generation. 
Although the course design has been completed, there are still some problems in the backfilling of the semantic analysis department.
